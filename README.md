## Features

TODO: List what your package can do. Maybe include images, gifs, or videos.

## Getting started

### Installing local devices

```bash
flutter devices          # confirm Chrome or web-server is available
flutter run -d chrome    # runs [lib/main.dart](lib/main.dart) in Chrome
# or build static files and serve:
flutter build web
python -m http.server --directory build/web 8000
```

If Chrome doesn't show in `flutter devices`, enable web support with:

flutter config --enable-web
flutter doctor
```
